# IIS Deployment Status

## Configuration Complete ✅

The Enhanced Media Scraper application has been configured for IIS deployment under the `/scraper` path.

### What Was Fixed

1. **API Routing** 
   - All JavaScript files updated to use `window.APP_BASE` prefix (`/scraper`)
   - Fixed files:
     - `/static/js/working-asset-system.js`
     - `/static/js/modules/enhanced-search.js`
     - `/static/js/modules/simple-asset-manager.js`
     - `/static/js/dashboard-live.js`
     - `/static/js/modules/real-time-dashboard.js`

2. **Flask Configuration**
   - ProxyFix middleware properly configured in `app.py`
   - Handles `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers

3. **IIS Configuration**
   - `web.config` properly set up with URL rewrite rules
   - Application mapped to `/scraper` path
   - Reverse proxy to Flask app on port 5050

### Current Status

- **Flask App**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5050
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ Working correctly with `/scraper` prefix
- **IIS Configuration**: ✅ Properly configured in `web.config`
- **JavaScript**: ✅ All API calls use `APP_BASE` prefix

### Access Issue

Currently, nginx is intercepting requests on port 80, preventing IIS from serving the application.

To access via IIS:
1. Stop nginx: `sudo systemctl stop nginx`
2. Access: http://localhost/scraper

Alternatively, for testing:
- Direct Flask access: http://localhost:5050 (works but assets expect `/scraper` prefix)

### Next Steps

To fully deploy on IIS:
1. Either stop nginx or configure it to proxy to IIS for `/scraper` path
2. Or configure IIS to use a different port (e.g., 8080)

The application is fully configured and ready for IIS deployment once the port conflict is resolved.
