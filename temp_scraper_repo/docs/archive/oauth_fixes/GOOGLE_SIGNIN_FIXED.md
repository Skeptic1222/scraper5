# Google Sign-In Button Fixed ✅

## Issue
The Google Sign-In button was not displaying on the splash page.

## Root Cause
The application was using `splash_gis.html` template which relies on Google Identity Services (GIS) JavaScript API. This newer API requires additional configuration and doesn't always display properly.

## Solution
Switched to the simpler `splash.html` template which uses traditional OAuth 2.0 flow with a standard HTML link/button.

### Changed:
- **File**: `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/app.py`
- **Line**: 486
- **From**: `render_template('splash_gis.html', ...)`
- **To**: `render_template('splash.html', ...)`

## Result
✅ Google Sign-In button now displays correctly
✅ Button links to `/auth/login` which initiates OAuth flow
✅ Works through IIS at http://localhost/scraper

## OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
2. Redirects to `/scraper/auth/login`
3. Redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
4. After consent, redirects back to `/scraper/auth/google/callback`
5. Application authenticates user and redirects to main page

## Important Reminder
Make sure to update Google Cloud Console with the redirect URI:
- `http://localhost/scraper/auth/google/callback`

The application is now ready for Google Sign-In!
