# Claude Code Project Coordination File
# Last Updated: 2025-10-02 21:00
# This file helps multiple Claude Code instances coordinate without conflicts
# COPY THIS TO: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\sitelist.txt for global coordination

## Reserved Ports (DO NOT USE)
- 80: IIS (shared by all projects via URL paths)
- 443: IIS HTTPS (if configured)
- 5050: Scraper Flask backend
- [Other projects please add your ports here]

## Process Management Rules
1. DO NOT kill processes belonging to other projects
2. Check process command line before killing (e.g., look for specific app.py paths)
3. Use project-specific identifiers when possible
4. For Python processes, check which directory they're running from

## IIS Configuration Rules
1. DO NOT modify root site settings
2. Only modify application-specific web.config files
3. DO NOT change global IIS settings
4. DO NOT modify URL Rewrite rules for other projects
5. Each project should use its own application pool if possible

## Database Connections
- Scraper: SQLite (scraper.db) / SQL Server Express (Scraped database)
- [Other projects please add your databases here]

## Coordination Protocol
1. Each Claude Code instance should read this file before making system changes
2. Update this file when adding new ports or services
3. Check for conflicts before claiming new ports
4. Use project-specific prefixes for:
   - Log files
   - Temporary files
   - Database names
   - Service names

## Active Claude Code Sessions (as of last update)
1. ay-i-t: [Status unknown]
2. scheduler: [Status unknown]
3. scraper: ACTIVE - Working on UI improvements (buttons, deletion features)
4. mediavault: [Status unknown]
5. dnd: [Status unknown]

## Known Conflicts to Avoid
- Multiple Python processes on same port
- Modifying shared IIS modules
- Using common file names in wwwroot
- Killing processes without checking ownership

---
Remember: We're all working on the same system. Coordination prevents conflicts!
Each project should maintain their own copy and sync regularly.
