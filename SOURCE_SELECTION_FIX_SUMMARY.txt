# SOURCE SELECTION UI - FIX SUMMARY

## PROBLEM
- Main "Select All" only selected 87 sources (should select 112)
- Category "Select All" buttons skipped premium sources
- Individual premium source checkboxes were disabled/unclickable
- 25 premium sources (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) were completely unusable

## ROOT CAUSE
Line 156 in enhanced-search-ui.js: `checkbox.disabled = !source.enabled`
This disabled all premium sources, making them unselectable.

## SOLUTION
✅ Removed disabled attribute from all checkboxes
✅ Added data-is-premium attribute to track premium status
✅ Updated selectAll() to select ALL checkboxes (not just enabled)
✅ Updated selectAllInCategory() to include premium sources
✅ Changed visual styling - all sources now normal color with badges

## FILE MODIFIED
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\scraper\static\js\modules\enhanced-search-ui.js

## CHANGES
1. Lines 146-173: Removed checkbox.disabled, added data-is-premium
2. Lines 205-216: Removed if(source.enabled) check in selectAllInCategory()
3. Lines 254-261: Removed :not(:disabled) selector in selectAll()

## VERIFICATION
✅ Total sources: 112
✅ Disabled sources: 0 (was 25)
✅ "Select All" now selects: 112 (was 87)
✅ Premium sources clickable: YES
✅ Category "Select All" works: YES
✅ Individual selection works: YES

## HOW TO VERIFY
1. Go to http://localhost:5050
2. Click "Search & Download" section
3. Click "Select All" button
4. Verify count shows "112 selected"
5. Verify premium sources (Netflix, etc.) are checked
6. Click individual premium source - should work

## STATUS
✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED
All 112 sources are now fully selectable!
