# OAuth Fix Summary

OAuth authentication is now working successfully. The issue was:

1. SQL Server connection timeout from WSL2 
2. Fixed by switching to SQLite with correct WSL2 path: 
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/instance/scraper.db

User can now:
- Successfully authenticate with Google
- Access the dashboard with full functionality
- Maintain persistent sessions

Debug logs have been configured in /debug_logs/ for monitoring.
