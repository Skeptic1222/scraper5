## Modular Source & Download Handler System (Backend)

### Overview
- The backend now uses a `SourceHandlerRegistry` to register all sources and their search/download logic.
- Each source is registered with its search and (optionally) download function.
- The `ContentSource` class uses the registry to look up handlers, making it easy to add or modify sources.
- Download logic will use a custom download method if provided, otherwise it falls back to the default.

### How to Add a New Source
1. **Implement the search function** for your new source (e.g., `def enhanced_newsource_search(query, max_results, safe_search): ...`).
2. **(Optional) Implement a custom download function** if the default is not sufficient.
3. **Register the source** in `real_content_downloader.py`:
   ```python
   source_handler_registry.register(
       'newsource',
       search_func=enhanced_newsource_search,
       download_func=custom_download_func,  # Optional
       category='gallery',  # or 'video', 'search', etc.
       requires_no_safe_search=False
   )
   ```
4. **Add the source to the UI** if needed (see frontend instructions).

### Benefits
- No more editing large switch/case statements or maps.
- All source logic is modular and easy to maintain.
- Download methods are pluggable per source.
