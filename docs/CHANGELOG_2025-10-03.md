# Changelog - October 3, 2025
## Major Improvements and System Enhancements

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive improvements including retry logic, performance tracking, gallery-dl configuration, and enhanced logging system for continuous optimization.

---

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Advanced Retry Logic for yt-dlp (HIGH IMPACT)
**File**: `scrapers/scraping_methods.py:43-140`
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What Changed**:
- Added intelligent retry system with 3 attempts per URL
- Exponential backoff delay: 1s, 2s, 4s
- Progressive timeout increase: 120s → 180s → 240s
- Smart error detection (retryable vs non-retryable)

**Code Example**:
```python
max_retries = 3  # Retry up to 3 times
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    timeout = 120 + (60 * attempt)  # Increasing timeout
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=timeout)

    if result.returncode == 0:
        break  # Success!

    # Check if error is retryable
    if 'timeout' in stderr or 'connection' in stderr:
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        continue
```

**Expected Impact**:
- **15-20% improvement** in video download success rate
- Better handling of network glitches
- Reduced false failures from transient errors

**Before**: `VIDEO: yt-dlp timeout for ytsearch100:Twerksum`
**After**: Retries with increasing timeout, much higher success rate

### 2. Performance Tracking System (MONITORING)
**File**: `scrapers/performance_tracker.py` (NEW - 400+ lines)
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What It Does**:
- Tracks every scraping job with detailed metrics
- Records per-source performance (attempts, successes, duration, files)
- Generates performance reports over time
- Saves metrics to `logs/performance_metrics.json`

**Integration**:
- `enhanced_working_downloader.py:51-59` - Import
- `enhanced_working_downloader.py:670-672` - Start tracking
- `enhanced_working_downloader.py:741-751` - Track each source
- `enhanced_working_downloader.py:899-902` - Finalize tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
# View performance report for last 7 days
python scrapers/performance_tracker.py 7

# View last 30 days
python scrapers/performance_tracker.py 30
```

**Report Output**:
```
🟢 HIGH PERFORMERS (60%+ success rate):
  unsplash             | 95.0% | 125 files | 12.3s avg | api_direct
  pexels               | 90.0% |  85 files | 15.1s avg | api_direct

🟡 MEDIUM PERFORMERS (30-60% success rate):
  youtube              | 50.0% |  42 files | 180.2s avg | yt-dlp
  pornhub              | 45.0% | 156 files | 619.8s avg | yt-dlp

🔴 LOW PERFORMERS (<30% success rate - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT):
  reddit               |  5.0% |   2 files | No API credentials
  instagram            |  0.0% |   0 files | Not implemented
```

**Data Collected**:
- Job-level: ID, query, duration, files, images, videos, filtering stats
- Source-level: Method used, duration, files downloaded, success/failure, errors
- Filtering: Placeholders removed, sources blacklisted

---

### 3. Gallery-DL Configuration System (IMAGE GALLERIES)

   - **Solution**: Monitor if retries resolve issue

### Limitations:
1. **Gallery-dl requires API keys** - Most sources need registration
   - **Workaround**: Pinterest, ArtStation work without APIs
