# Google OAuth Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. **OAuth Hanging on Sign-In**
**Problem**: Users who were already authenticated were being redirected in a loop between splash page and main app.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `templates/splash.html` to redirect authenticated users to `/scraper/index.html` instead of `/scraper/`
- Added new route `/index.html` in `app.py` to handle direct access to main app
- Used `window.location.replace()` to prevent back button loops

### 2. **Session Not Persisting on Refresh**
**Problem**: Users had to log in again after page refresh.

**Solution Applied**:
- Extended session lifetime to 30 days (`PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME`)
- Enabled permanent sessions by default (`SESSION_PERMANENT = True`)
- Configured remember cookie for 30-day persistence
- Set `remember=True` in all `login_user()` calls (already present)
- Session protection changed from 'strong' to 'basic' to allow persistence

### 3. **Auth Check Working**
- Endpoint `/scraper/auth/check` returns proper JSON response
- Returns `{"authenticated": false}` for logged out users
- Returns user data when authenticated

## Configuration Updates

### Session Settings (app.py)
```python
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(days=30)
app.config['SESSION_PERMANENT'] = True
app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_NAME'] = 'scraper_remember'
app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION'] = timedelta(days=30)
app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_PATH'] = '/scraper'
app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
app.config['REMEMBER_COOKIE_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = False
```

### Routes Added (app.py)
- `/index.html` - Direct access to main app, avoids redirect loop

### JavaScript Updates (splash.html)
```javascript
// Check authentication on page load
fetch('/scraper/auth/check')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.authenticated) {
            // Redirect to main app, not back to splash
            window.location.replace('/scraper/index.html');
        }
    })
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Splash page** shows for unauthenticated users
✅ **Auth check endpoint** working correctly
✅ **Session cookies** properly configured with correct path
✅ **No redirect loops** when authenticated
✅ **30-day session persistence** configured

## OAuth Flow Now Works As Expected:

1. **First Visit**: User sees splash page with Google sign-in
2. **After Login**: User redirected to main app (`index.html`)
3. **On Refresh**:
   - If authenticated → Stays on main app (no login prompt)
   - If not authenticated → Shows splash page
4. **Session Persistence**: Sessions last 30 days with remember me

## Important URLs (NO PORTS!)

- Main App: `http://localhost/scraper/`
- Direct App Access: `http://localhost/scraper/index.html`
- Login: `http://localhost/scraper/auth/login`
- Auth Check: `http://localhost/scraper/auth/check`
- Logout: `http://localhost/scraper/logout`

## Files Modified

1. `/templates/splash.html` - Fixed redirect for authenticated users
2. `/app.py` - Added `/index.html` route and session configuration
3. Session lifetime extended to 30 days

The OAuth hanging issue is now resolved. Authenticated users will not be prompted to login on refresh, and sessions persist for 30 days.
