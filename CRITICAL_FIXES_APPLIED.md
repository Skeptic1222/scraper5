**Issues Fixed:** Download hanging + Source filtering

## ‚úÖ FIX #1: Thread-Safe Session (COMPLETED)

### Problem
Downloads worked in isolation but hung when called from ThreadPoolExecutor in job context. Multiple threads shared a single `requests.Session()` instance, which is NOT thread-safe, causing blocking/deadlock.

### Root Cause
```python
# OLD (working_media_downloader.py line 112):
self.session = requests.Session()  # Shared across all threads - NOT thread-safe!
```

### Solution Implemented
```python
# NEW: Thread-local sessions
import threading

class WorkingMediaDownloader:
    def __init__(self, output_dir=None):
        # Thread-local storage for sessions
        self._local = threading.local()

        # Store session config for thread-local creation
        self._session_config = {
            'max_retries': self.max_retries,
            'user_agent': '...'
        }

    @property
    def session(self):
        """Get thread-local session (creates one per thread for thread-safety)"""
        if not hasattr(self._local, 'session'):
            # Create new session for this thread
            session = requests.Session()
            # Configure retry strategy, adapters, headers...
            self._local.session = session
            print(f"[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread {threading.current_thread().name}")
        return self._local.session
```

### Verification
```bash
python test_parallel_download.py
```

**Result:**
```
[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0
[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1
[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread ThreadPoolExecutor-0_2
[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread ThreadPoolExecutor-0_3
[THREAD-SAFE] Created new session for thread ThreadPoolExecutor-0_4

=== RESULTS ===
Total downloads: 5
Successful: 5
Failed: 0
Time elapsed: 2.98s
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Downloads now work perfectly in parallel/threaded context!

## ‚úÖ FIX #2: Missing Sources in API List (COMPLETED)

### Problem
User reported: "Only 3 sources used instead of all selected sources"

Selected sources:
- ‚úÖ google_images (enhanced scraper)
- ‚úÖ bing_images (enhanced scraper)
- ‚ùå yahoo_images (enhanced scraper)
- ‚úÖ unsplash (API scraper)
- ‚ùå pexels (was missing from api_sources list!)

### Root Cause
In `enhanced_working_downloader.py` line 137:
```python
# OLD:
api_sources = ['unsplash', 'picsum', 'placeholder', 'dummyimage', 'lorempixel', 'robohash']
# pexels was MISSING!
```

When a source is not in `enhanced_sources`, `video_sources`, or `api_sources`, it falls through to the `else` clause which uses the basic downloader (which might not work properly).

### Solution Implemented
```python
# NEW:
api_sources = ['unsplash', 'pexels', 'pixabay', 'picsum', 'placeholder', 'dummyimage', 'lorempixel', 'robohash']
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - pexels and pixabay now properly handled by API scraper!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUE: Yahoo Images

Yahoo is in `enhanced_sources` list (line 135):
```python
enhanced_sources = ['google', 'bing', 'yahoo', 'duckduckgo', 'yandex']
```

But if user reports it's not working, the enhanced scraper might not support yahoo properly. This needs testing.

## üß™ Testing Required

### Test 1: Parallel Downloads (Already Verified ‚úÖ)
```bash
python test_parallel_download.py
# Expected: All 5 downloads succeed
# Result: PASSED - 5/5 successful
```

### Test 2: Source Storage in Database (Already Verified ‚úÖ)
```bash
python test_source_filtering.py
# Expected: All 5 sources stored correctly
# Result: PASSED - All sources present
```

### Test 3: Full Job with All 5 Sources (NEEDS TESTING)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/scraper/api/comprehensive-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "test",
    "enabled_sources": ["google_images", "bing_images", "yahoo_images", "unsplash", "pexels"],
    "max_content": 10,
    "safe_search": true
  }'
```

**Expected:**
- Job starts successfully
- All 5 sources are processed
- Files download from all sources
- Job completes with downloaded files

**Check logs for:**
```
[ENHANCED SCRAPER]: google_images
[ENHANCED SCRAPER]: bing_images
[ENHANCED SCRAPER]: yahoo_images
[API SCRAPER]: unsplash
[API SCRAPER]: pexels
```

## üìã Summary

### Problems Solved:
1. ‚úÖ **Thread-safe sessions** - Downloads no longer hang in parallel context
2. ‚úÖ **Pexels source** - Now properly categorized as API source

### Remaining Questions:
- ‚ùì Does yahoo_images work with enhanced scraper?
- ‚ùì Does the basic downloader (else clause) work properly for uncategorized sources?

### Success Metrics:
- [x] Downloads work in isolation
- [x] Downloads work in parallel (5/5 threads)
- [x] Database stores all selected sources
- [ ] **All selected sources execute and download files** (needs full job test)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test complete workflow** with all 5 sources
2. **Monitor logs** to verify all sources are processed
3. **Check download directory** for files from all sources
4. **If yahoo fails**, investigate enhanced scraper yahoo support
