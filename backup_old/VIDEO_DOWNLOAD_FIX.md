# Video Download and Command Center Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Command Center Display Not Updating** ✅
**Problem**: The command center was showing all zeros (Files Scanned: 0, Downloaded: 0%, etc.) even during active downloads.

**Root Cause**: 
- The JavaScript was looking for the wrong element IDs
- The `totalDownloaded` element wasn't being updated properly
- Stats mapping was incorrect

**Fix**:
- Updated `updateCommandCenter()` function to properly map job data to display elements
- Added explicit element updates for `totalScanned`, `totalDownloaded`, `successRateValue`, etc.
- Now displays real-time progress during downloads

### 2. **Video Downloads Failing** ✅
**Problem**: Videos were being detected but none were downloading, with error:
```
ERROR: _parse_browser_specification() takes from 1 to 4 positional arguments but 6 were given
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The `cookiesfrombrowser` parameter in yt-dlp was incorrectly defined as a list `['chrome', 'firefox']`
- yt-dlp expects a single string value, not a list

**Fix**:
- Changed `'cookiesfrombrowser': ['chrome', 'firefox']` to `'cookiesfrombrowser': 'chrome'`
- This applies to both Instagram and Twitter download methods
- Videos should now download properly from YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and other supported platforms

## What You Should See Now

### Command Center Display
During downloads, you should see real-time updates:
- **Files Scanned**: Shows total number of URLs found
- **Downloaded**: Shows actual count of downloaded files
- **Success Rate**: Shows percentage of successful downloads
- **Total Size**: Estimated size of downloaded content
- **Speed**: Download speed in KB/s
- **Time Elapsed**: Running timer showing MM:SS

### Video Downloads
When searching for videos:
1. The system will detect video URLs from various platforms
2. Videos will actually download using yt-dlp
3. Multiple quality fallbacks (720p → 480p → best available)
4. Platform-specific handling for Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok
5. Direct download fallback for .mp4/.webm files

### Activity Feed
The scrolling activity feed will show:
- Timestamps of actions
- File names being downloaded
- Status messages
- Real download progress

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Try a video search (select "Videos" in search type)
2. Watch the command center - numbers should update in real-time
3. Videos should actually download
4. Check the Assets Library to see downloaded videos

## Additional Improvements

- Better error handling for unavailable videos
- Chrome cookie integration for authenticated content
- Thumbnail downloads alongside videos
- Increased file size limit to 200MB for videos
