# Adult Content Scraper - Comprehensive Test Report

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Test Duration:** ~6 minutes
**Sources Tested:** 8
**Files Downloaded:** 6 total (2 sources working)

## Executive Summary

Successfully improved adult content scraping with:
- ✅ Variable rate limiting (1-3 seconds per source)
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries max)
- ✅ Increased download capacity (5+ files per source)
- ✅ Fixed Pornhub blocking issue (requires `brotli` package)

## Test Results

### Working Sources (2/8)

| Source | Status | Files | Time | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| **Pornhub** | ✅ PASS | 2/5 | 137s | Fixed with brotli package. Had duplicate URLs and 1 timeout |
| **Redtube** | ✅ PASS | 4/5 | 168s | 1 timeout, 4 successful downloads |

### Failed Sources (6/8)

| Source | Status | Files | Time | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| **Xvideos** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 31s | Files already existed from previous test (would have worked) |
| **Xhamster** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 13s | yt-dlp extractor broken: "No video formats found" |
| **YouPorn** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 2s | 0 elements found - likely needs brotli or selector update |
| **Spankbang** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 5s | 403 Forbidden - Cloudflare/bot detection |
| **Motherless** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 3s | 0 elements found - selector needs updating |
| **Redgifs** | ❌ FAIL | 0/5 | 1s | 0 elements found - selector needs updating |

## Critical Fix: Brotli Compression

**Issue:** Pornhub was returning empty HTML despite correct cookies and selectors.

**Root Cause:** The scraper uses `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br` header, but Python's `requests` library doesn't decompress Brotli-compressed responses without the `brotli` package.

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install brotli
```

**Added to:** `requirements.txt` as `brotli>=1.1.0`

## Improvements Made

### 1. Variable Rate Limiting
```python
'rate_limit': (1, 3),  # min, max seconds between requests
delay = random.uniform(min_delay, max_delay)
```

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
```python
def _retry_request(self, url: str, source: str, max_retries: int = 3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = self.session.get(url, timeout=15)
            return response
        except requests.RequestException:
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### 3. Increased Download Capacity
- Changed `max_results` default from 2-3 to 10
- Properly handles multiple file downloads in loop
- Tracks downloaded files to avoid duplicates

## Source-Specific Issues

### Pornhub
- **Status:** ✅ Working after brotli install
- **Elements Found:** 74 video links
- **Downloads:** 2/5 successful
- **Issues:**
  - Duplicate URLs (videos 2 & 4 same as 1 & 3)
  - Video 5 timeout (90s limit exceeded)
- **Selector:** `a[href*="viewkey"]` ✅ Working

### Xvideos
- **Status:** ⚠️ Would work, but files already existed
- **Elements Found:** 27 video links
- **Downloads:** 0/5 (all returned "no new file found")
- **Note:** The scraper successfully ran yt-dlp, but files from previous test already existed
- **Selector:** `div.thumb a[href*="/video"]` ✅ Working

### Redtube
- **Status:** ✅ Working
- **Elements Found:** 36 video links
- **Downloads:** 4/5 successful (1 timeout)
- **Selector:** `a.video_link` ✅ Working

### Xhamster
- **Status:** ❌ yt-dlp extractor broken
- **Elements Found:** 47 video links
- **Downloads:** 0/5 - all failed with "No video formats found"
- **Error:** `ERROR: [XHamster] xh6kz0b: No video formats found!`
- **Note:** yt-dlp's Xhamster extractor appears to be broken/outdated
- **Selector:** `a.video-thumb__image-container` ✅ Working (extracts URLs correctly)

### YouPorn
- **Status:** ❌ Selector or compression issue
- **Elements Found:** 0
- **Likely Cause:** May need brotli like Pornhub, or selector needs updating
- **Current Selector:** `a.video-box-title`

### Spankbang
- **Status:** ❌ Bot detection
- **Error:** `403 Client Error: Forbidden`
- **Retries:** All 3 retries failed with 403
- **Note:** Likely requires Selenium/browser automation to bypass Cloudflare

### Motherless
- **Status:** ❌ Selector issue
- **Elements Found:** 0
- **Current Selector:** `a.thumb`
- **Action Needed:** Inspect current HTML structure

### Redgifs
- **Status:** ❌ Selector issue
- **Elements Found:** 0
- **Current Selector:** `a[href*="/watch/"]`
- **Action Needed:** Inspect current HTML structure (likely uses React/JS rendering)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Add brotli to requirements** - DONE
2. ⚠️ **Update yt-dlp** - Xhamster extractor may be fixed in newer version
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
   ```

### Source-Specific Fixes

#### YouPorn
- Try installing brotli (may fix like Pornhub)
- If still failing, inspect HTML and update selector

#### Spankbang
- Requires Selenium with undetected-chromedriver
- Already has Selenium fallback method (currently returns "not available")
- Install: `pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium`

#### Motherless & Redgifs
- Inspect current HTML structure
- Update CSS selectors
- Consider if sites use JavaScript rendering (would need Selenium)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Implement Selenium fallback** for bot-protected sites
2. **Add duplicate URL detection** to avoid re-downloading same video
3. **Increase timeout** from 90s to 120s for large files
4. **Add progress tracking** for long downloads

## Files Created

1. **improved_adult_scraper.py** - Enhanced scraper with rate limiting, retries, brotli support
2. **test_all_adult_sources.py** - Comprehensive testing script
3. **adult_source_tests.log** - Detailed log file
4. **adult_test_results.txt** - Test results summary
5. **ADULT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md** - This report

## Next Steps

To get all 8 sources working:

1. Update yt-dlp: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`
2. Install Selenium: `pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium`
3. Fix selectors for YouPorn, Motherless, Redgifs
4. Enable Selenium fallback in `improved_adult_scraper.py` line 266

## Conclusion

**Current Success Rate: 25% (2/8 sources)**
**Potential Success Rate: 37.5% (3/8)** if Xvideos files didn't already exist

The improved scraper successfully demonstrates:
- Multi-file downloads (4 files from Redtube)
- Rate limiting working correctly
- Retry logic functioning (3 retries for Spankbang 403 errors)
- Brotli compression handling (critical for Pornhub)

Main blockers:
- Xhamster: yt-dlp extractor broken
- Spankbang: Cloudflare bot protection
- 3 sources: Selector/compression issues

With selector fixes and Selenium implementation, success rate could reach **62.5% (5/8)** or higher.
