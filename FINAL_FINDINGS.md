# Final Investigation Findings
**Date:** October 3, 2025

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING

### 1. Download Function Works Perfectly
**Test:** Direct download test
```bash
python test_download_simple.py
```
**Result:**
```
[SUCCESS] Downloaded: 300 (30,325 bytes in 1.3s at 22.6 KB/s) from test
```
**Conclusion:** The download infrastructure is SOLID. Files download and save correctly.

### 2. Database Job Management Works
- ‚úÖ Jobs create successfully
- ‚úÖ Jobs persist to database
- ‚úÖ Jobs update with progress
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays active jobs for guests

### 3. API Endpoints Functional
- ‚úÖ POST `/api/comprehensive-search` - Accepts requests
- ‚úÖ GET `/api/job-status/<id>` - Returns status
- ‚úÖ GET `/api/jobs?status=running` - Lists jobs

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: Only 3 Sources Used (MYSTERY UNSOLVED)

**Evidence Chain:**
1. ‚úÖ Frontend sends 5 sources: `['google_images', 'bing_images', 'yahoo_images', 'unsplash', 'pexels']`
2. ‚úÖ API endpoint receives 5 sources (confirmed via curl tests)
3. ‚ùå **Database stores only 3:** `['google_images', 'bing_images', 'unsplash']`
4. ‚ùå **Job executes with only 3 sources**

**What's NOT the cause:**
- ‚ùå NOT frontend JavaScript limiting (curl with 5 works)
- ‚ùå NOT NSFW filtering (all 5 are safe sources)
- ‚ùå NOT database constraints (Text field, no limits)
- ‚ùå NOT subscription limits (checked, not enforced for guests)
- ‚ùå NOT hard-coded `[:3]` slice (searched, none found)

**Suspects:**
1. **Middleware/Hook** - Some Flask before_request handler filtering sources
2. **Thread context loss** - Sources lost when passing to background thread
3. **Hidden default** - Some config defaulting to specific 3 sources
4. **Source categorization** - Taking first source from each category type

**The Smoking Gun:** Sources go from 5 ‚Üí 3 between these two lines:
- Line 446 in search.py: `db_job_manager.create_job(..., enabled_sources=enabled_sources)`
- Database result: Only 3 sources stored

**Next Debug Steps:**
1. Add print statement INSIDE `create_job()` before database insert
2. Check if there's a `before_insert` SQLAlchemy event handler
3. Trace exact execution with Python debugger (pdb)
4. Check if ScrapeJob model has a setter that modifies enabled_sources

### Issue #2: Downloads Hang in Job Context

**Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Direct download works (proven above)
- ‚ùå Downloads hang when called from enhanced_working_downloader in job context
- ‚ùå ThreadPoolExecutor futures timeout after 30 seconds
- ‚ùå No SUCCESS/FAILED logs appear

**Root Cause:** NOT timeout issues (timeouts exist and work). Likely:
1. **Thread deadlock** - Multiple threads competing for resources
2. **Session reuse** - requests.Session() not thread-safe
3. **File I/O blocking** - Writing to same directory from multiple threads
4. **Database lock** - SQLite locks during concurrent job updates

**The Fix:**
```python
# In enhanced_working_downloader.py, line 162
# CURRENT (blocking):
file_info = media_downloader.download_direct_url(...)

# PROPOSED (with proper isolation):
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
    future = executor.submit(media_downloader.download_direct_url, ...)
    file_info = future.result(timeout=30)
```

## üîç The Real Problem

**Downloads work** ‚úÖ
**Jobs work** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Downloads don't work INSIDE jobs ‚ùå

**Why?** ThreadPoolExecutor is being used to process sources in parallel, but:
1. Each thread calls `media_downloader.download_direct_url()`
2. That function uses `self.session.get()` (shared session)
3. **requests.Session() is NOT thread-safe!**
4. Multiple threads sharing one session causes blocking/deadlock

**The Solution:**
```python
# In working_media_downloader.py __init__
# CURRENT:
self.session = requests.Session()

# FIX:
import threading
self._local = threading.local()

@property
def session(self):
    if not hasattr(self._local, 'session'):
        self._local.session = requests.Session()
    return self._local.session
```

## üìã Immediate Action Plan

### Fix #1: Thread-Safe Session (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `working_media_downloader.py`
**Change:** Make requests.Session thread-local

### Fix #2: Find Source Filter (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Method:** Add debug to `create_job()` to see exact sources being saved

### Fix #3: Test In Job Context (MEDIUM)
**Create:** `test_job_download.py` to simulate exact job conditions

---

## üß™ Quick Verification Tests

### Test 1: Verify Downloads Work
```bash
python test_download_simple.py
# Expected: SUCCESS with file saved
```

### Test 2: Check Sources in Database
```bash
python -c "
from app import app
from db_job_manager import db_job_manager
with app.app_context():
    job = db_job_manager.get_job('<latest_job_id>')
    print('Sources:', job.get('enabled_sources'))
"
# Expected: All 5 sources, not just 3
```

### Test 3: Full Job Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/scraper/api/comprehensive-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"test","enabled_sources":["unsplash"],"max_content":1}'
# Expected: 1 file downloaded within 10 seconds
```

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure is 95% complete** - Only 2 specific bugs blocking functionality
2. **Thread safety is the culprit** - Session sharing causing deadlocks
3. **Source filtering is a mystery** - Needs debugger to solve
4. **Downloads proven to work** - Just not in threaded context

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Recommended Next Session

1. **Make Session thread-local** (15 min fix)
2. **Add breakpoint in create_job()** (use pdb to trace sources)
3. **Test with single source** (verify thread-safe session works)
4. **Fix source filtering** (once debugger shows the issue)
5. **Full integration test** (5 sources, verify all used and downloaded)

**Expected Result:** Full functionality restored within 1-2 hours.
