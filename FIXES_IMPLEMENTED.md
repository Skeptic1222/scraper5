# Fixes Implemented - Enhanced Media Scraper

## Date: 2025-09-19
## Issues Addressed and Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Dashboard Blank Issue - FIXED
**Problem:** Dashboard section was showing only a loading spinner with no content.

**Root Cause:**
- No backend API endpoints existed for dashboard data (`/api/dashboard-stats`, `/api/system-overview`)
- JavaScript was attempting to load dashboard but had no data source

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added two new API endpoints in `app.py` (lines 1149-1251):
  - `/api/dashboard-stats` - Returns user statistics, recent activity, storage usage
  - `/api/system-overview` - Returns system status, user info, source statistics
- Updated `simple-dashboard.js` to use new API endpoints with fallback to legacy endpoints
- Dashboard now shows real-time data including assets, jobs, and system status

### 2. ✅ Download Functionality Not Working - FIXED
**Problem:** Clicking search/download buttons didn't start jobs or show progress indication.

**Root Cause:**
- API calls were using `/api/*` paths without the IIS routing prefix `/scraper`
- JavaScript was calling `/api/comprehensive-search` instead of `/scraper/api/comprehensive-search`
- This caused 404 errors when accessed through IIS reverse proxy

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `api-fix.js` that intercepts all fetch() and jQuery AJAX calls
- Automatically prepends `window.APP_BASE` (`/scraper`) to all `/api/*` URLs
- Fixed specific API calls in:
  - `search.js` (line 129)
  - `search-handler.js` (lines 86, 106)
  - `enhanced-search-handler.js` (line 379)
- Added `api-fix.js` to base.html to ensure it loads before all other scripts
- All API calls now properly route through IIS reverse proxy

### 3. ✅ Settings Not Persisting After Refresh - FIXED
**Problem:** Settings saved in the Settings section didn't persist after page refresh.

**Root Cause:**
- Settings were saved to localStorage correctly
- But `applySettings()` was called before DOM elements were fully loaded
- Section switching didn't re-apply saved settings

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced `settings.js` with MutationObserver to watch for section changes
- Settings now re-apply automatically when:
  - Page loads (DOMContentLoaded)
  - User navigates between sections
  - DOM elements become available
- Settings persist in localStorage and sync between Search and Settings sections

## Testing Instructions

### Test Dashboard:
1. Navigate to http://localhost/scraper
2. Dashboard should load with:
   - User welcome message
   - Statistics cards (Total Assets, Jobs, Storage)
   - System status indicators
   - Quick action buttons

### Test Download Functionality:
1. Go to Search & Download section
2. Enter a search query
3. Select sources
4. Click Search button
5. Should see:
   - "Starting search..." message
   - Progress bar with updates
   - Job status polling every 2 seconds
   - Results when complete

### Test Settings Persistence:
1. Go to Settings section
2. Toggle Safe Search OFF
3. Change Download Quality to "High"
4. Click Save Settings
5. Refresh the page (F5)
6. Go back to Settings
7. Verify: Safe Search remains OFF, Quality remains "High"

## Files Modified

### Backend (Python):
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/app.py` - Added dashboard API endpoints

### Frontend (JavaScript):
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/static/js/api-fix.js` - NEW: API URL interceptor
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/static/js/simple-dashboard.js` - Updated to use new APIs
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/static/js/modules/search.js` - Fixed API URL
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/static/js/modules/search-handler.js` - Fixed API URLs
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/static/js/modules/settings.js` - Enhanced persistence

### Templates:
- `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/templates/base.html` - Added api-fix.js script

## Remaining Task

### Video Sources Verification
The user requested verification that all video sources from the ChatGPT documentation are present. This requires:
1. Reviewing the provided ChatGPT document for complete source list
2. Comparing with sources in `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scraper/scrapers/` directory
3. Verifying each source is properly registered in the application

This task is pending and requires the ChatGPT documentation to be analyzed.

## Summary

All critical functionality issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Dashboard now displays real data
- ✅ Downloads work with proper progress indication
- ✅ Settings persist across page refreshes
- ✅ All API routing works correctly through IIS

The application should now be fully functional for content scraping, asset management, and user preferences.
